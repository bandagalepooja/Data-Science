I immediately felt I was listening to a more intimate conversation with the Keepers of the Akashic. While some books try to explain how to access information from the Akashic, Lumari speaks about the collective itself. In this way, I could feel the energies of the Collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life. I felt like I was invited into the Akashic - to listen, to learn and to understand.This book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness. The energy quality of this book is excellent! The meditation in this book is a profound journey into greater wisdom and spirit. I highly recommend this book and Lumari's other book, Alawashka, too!\n",

And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.\n",

I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you're a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel's other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I'm afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You'll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird\n",

If you are either of these things, this is a no-brainer purchase. But even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories, this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price.It would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something. Suffice to say, some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the Marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the 17th century. I should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces. If all you know is the art that appeared in comics in the eighties, you will relish in this advancement.\n",

Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he's an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There's nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story.

The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you're a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others.

But there are good aspects to the game such as --i think-- 9 different types of weapons to choose from, along with great and funny sounds to go along with them. Buy it if you like, but beware, there are a lot of time wasting stages to go through, so if you are buying for pure enjoyment and not time wasting, be careful--get some cheats to let you skip levels or something..\n",

Now maybe because it's a older model we can not get a replacement from seller maybe because it was a older model setting around and thus reason for problem in the first place. Now I had a guy install unit modify window to fit their unit and can not get warrantied as maker only changes smaller units out. Seller will not replace with current model aes3105 even though unit they sold me is defective and non-functional couple years old according to maker of units. It will only blow warm air nothing close to cold with out freon. Maker said unit is a couple year older model and they will only exchange it a 4 week process in the middle of coming summer in OK.

In the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm.I love the combination of technology and magecraft. High tech verses an agrigarian society.

The first book may have been good, but Coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems, characters, or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting. The magic system was vague (which is fine for a first novel, but by the conclusion I want some explanation) and unimaginative, as were many of the characters.

I don't know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch. In my opinion this album as a whole, contains his best music in twenty years. None of the songs stand-out above the rest, but they are all solid. His past 5-6 studio albums contain 1-2 great songs surrounded by very bland ones. Recent albums may have had good lyrics, but the music doesn't stand up to the standards Merle has set in the past. \"Chicago Wind\" is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this.It is a shame that most C&W; radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political, social, economic or environmental issues.\n",

Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well.

The Curse of Monkey Island is none of these things. Rather, it feels like a harsh and manufactured attempt to recreate what made the first two games so great. It does not succeed. Without Ron Gilbert, and without the slightest idea of what the first two games were about, The Curse of Monkey Island, had it been called something else (as it should have) might have been okay. But its poor graphics, mostly unfunny humor, and theme completely foreign to the series make it a game no fun of the series should bother to play.

            "__label__2 Good Adaptation of a Superb Novel: The National TreeDavid Kranes' outstanding novel, The National Tree, finds a solid adaptation in this Hallmark production. The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President's lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored. Kranes' characteristic gentle and offbeat humor comes through so much more completely in the book which has become a family Christmas Classic for so many people.\n",

Along the way the boy meets up with his online girl 'friend' who decides to tag along, without Dad knowing... and gruff Dad starts having feelings for the go-getter PR woman (and vice-versa) traveling behind them arranging for media attention. The plot was predictable from the get-go, and the acting was uninspired.... about as 'wooden' as the tree they are carrying in the back of the big rig. Mediocre Hallmark viewing here; certainly NOT worth buying the dvd in my humble opinion.\n",

As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn't talk about frozen yogurt.

Why is this? It's become a throw-away society, quality is on the decline. Speedball probably thinks that few will notice the reduction in quality (except for the handful of professionals who are experts on their materials), so why not cut some corners and make more profits?I've been using drawing/inking art supplies for 22 years professionally and I have a hard time getting these to do their job now.

            "__label__2 Different Battles is a fascinating read.: Different Battles is a truly unusual book. It's a meticulously researched, vividly imagined historical study. But it's also a moving personal memoir--all the more powerful for being understated. On top of all that, it's a fascinating read.The author grew up in Vero Beach, Florida during World War II when German subs were a greater threat along the U.S. East coast than most people realized. The boy's father, Kit Johnson, uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the Germans. He later fights a very \"different battle\" with Alzheimer's. Peter Cremer, the charismatic and somewhat enigmatic Commander of a German U-boat, captures the reader's imagination. But as we gradually come to realize, the author's father is the real hero of the book.\n",

I encourage you to read this book and just enjoy the beauty of how much God loves us.\n",
            "__label__2 Simply Divine: This book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with Christ. It's an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy. Reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read.\n",

            "__label__1 Good Singer/Bad Songs: I love, love, love, love Marc Anthony; he is one of my favorite Latino singers, and I have followed him from the beginning of his career. If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other \"latin craze\" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now \"the rage\" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released. In other countries, the music scene is much more international...\n",

While longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they've always known him for, there's still plenty of continuity in the fact that he's as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic.Then again, Marc Anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots, so would-be critics should be warned--he wont be tied down. The single I Need to Know, with its pulsing salsa horns and piano, was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the Latin floodgate opened by Ricky Martin (Anthony used to sing back up to Menudo)and others.Thats Okay delves a bit deeper into the clave, while the plaintive How Could I combines the fluid fire of Spanish guitar with soft, slow-jam programming. A sweet pop nugget, You Sang to Me offers soaring waves of keyboard as Anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency.Sexy, salsa king rides the crossover wave.\n",

This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can't dish out zero stars.

Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth.

Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.\n",
            "__label__1 Disappointing: I couldn't muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page 41. I found it difficult to relate to, sympathize with, or even respect the characters. They were intolerable, existing only to drive the plot. The book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity, but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic, gender, racial, economic, generational, and, especially, the individual divide.The characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior, manner, and thought. A stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book.\n",
            "__label__1 Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy: I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she's lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope.\n",
            "__label__2 Good book: Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn't a \"downer.\"Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for \"belonging\" as is almost everybody else in the book.You'll enjoy this book, It's not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion.\n",
            "__label__1 Boring: I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It's my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn't connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears.\n",
            "__label__1 Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book: I've read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven't finished it yet) isn't very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I'm just going to have to set aside a few hours and \"get it out of the way\" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain't moving along.\n",
            "__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.\n",
            "__label__2 Romance & Politics: The Devil's Paw, a novel of espionage and intrigue during World War I, is very dated in light of subsequent historical events, but it is facinating nonetheless. There is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters, but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of England at that time. Julian Orden, son of a British aristocrat and vocal espouser of the Socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets Catherine, a young woman of mixed antecedents--British and Russian. In her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before. These two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of Germany and England to force a premature end to World War I. I enjoyed this book, but unless you are interested in the philosophy of British politics and the position of Socialism in that era, I would suggest another choice.\n",

I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a \"guide on the side\". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt.

            "__label__1 I didn't love it.: This story of Grace O'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn't bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce's fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce's use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the \"romance\" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it.\n",

INTERIORS is a story of one woman's personal journey through some of life's darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant's life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life.

One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed.

            "__label__1 not as I expected: I was so hopeful that this would work. When I used the balls, I found it painful and was very sore the next day. Might not be for people with fibromyalgia. I might try again but I'm a little wary.\n",
            "__label__1 These little balls did very little to help my pain.: I am disappointed with this product. Most of the exercises are basic stretches, which do not require the balls. The balls do feel good while using them, but do not provide relief beyond that. In fact, I'm not so sure that they don't make painful areas worse. The smell of the balls is horrendous. I have no idea why everyone has written so many good reviews. I've had several of my friends try them out also and they think that they're just a waste of time. I would certainly not purchase again.\n",

            "__label__1 This music requires an almost supernatural technique...: Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone's got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It's interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!\n",
            "__label__1 Nonsense.: Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky's American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I've heard since Szidon's hysterical Scriabin or Pollini's brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all.\n",
            "__label__2 Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets \"aspects\" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.\n",

Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I'm afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven 'how-to' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest 'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form.\n",

My rescue contact suggested that I try Good Boy. After one day of adding it to his water, he became totally different. Slept like a baby while I was gone and when I got home was back to normal. It seemed like I was drugging him b/c it was so effective. But he is very normal and active whenever I was around. Odd. After a few days I decided to stop putting it in his water b/c I was worried that it was too much. But after that, he just stayed calm all the time. I think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner. Ever since then, he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore. It really saved the day for me! (and him...)

This Album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer Bebu Silvetti and His Mexican compatriot The master of such hits as \"It's impossible\", \"Adore\", and \"Yesterday I heard the rain\", the legendary Armando Manzanero. This album celebrates love and not sexuality.

The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson's rhythms), but there's by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record.

In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it.

Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless \"build\" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn't building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is \"scary!\" or \"terrifying!\" shouldn't read horror novels whatsoever. I've read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary.\n",

In all honesty, my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character. In this book, I found no one. I was turned off by every person in the story. And as for the chills, I did not see what the other reviewers saw.I have never been one to put someone off of something. But this time I just had to write something down.

That relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out. The easy way out is to make rules about how we should live, such as \"never drink alcohol\" and \"never go to movies.\" Wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer's growth. He explains in simple but precise ways that the Law of Moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things: (1) we cannot please God by following the Law because we can't follow the Law (2)and the Law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the Law. That savior is none other than Jesus, the mediator between a holy God and unholy mankind. Wiersbe's book is simply a great book. Read it and Be Free!\n",

The CD's got that old school rock and roll feel that everyone can appreciate. It's definitly worth listening to!\n",
            "__label__2 Historical romance, A Gentle Giving: I just finished A Gentle Giving, by Dorothy Garlock, and it was wonderful! This one was not one of my favorites of hers, but it was very good. Willa actually escaped a house in flames, caused by the angry townsfolk, in nothing more than ther nightgown. The family she joins up with, lends her clothing... so not even owning the clothing on her body, she is thrust into the hard life of a wagon trail. When the father is killed, leaving behind two teenagers to fend for themselves, Willa chooses to help them get to their next of kin in the Big Horn Mountains. This was an excellent read... and I'm off to read The Listening Sky by Dorothy Garlock now.\n",

            "__label__1 Action packed but hard to enjoy: It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot. To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine.\n",

            "__label__2 Surprisingly moving: Although a documentary, it was a surprisingly moving and warm film. The main character, the faithful monk Tenzin, is very likable, and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher's new incarnation. There is a scene where he revisits his late teacher's now-abandoned and ruined retreat home, and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry. Depictions like that abound in this film - moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world. There are also moments of joy, like the scene where Tenzin and his reincarnated master, now a very young boy, are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass. This is not a story about Buddhism as much as it is a story about love.\n",

The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided.

It is a rambling and tedious book to read. While I felt I should put it down, I skimmed it, and still got the story. I am one who could have easily put it down at any time.

This story reminds us of what is truly important in this life and to not identify people by their limitations. It's laugh out loud funny at times and definitely keeps you turning the pages. He really gives you an insight into the daily lives and tribulations of ordinary people you might otherwise ignore and depicts them in bizarre circumstances at times that give them an opportunity to show their inner strength in a truly memorable way.

I usually read Koontz's books so rapidly that I'm disappointed when they're over. This book has been a trudgingly slow and boorish read. In comparison to \"Ticktock\" or \"Watchers\" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same. What a disappointment. Pick another one of Koontz's books. Not this one.\n",

She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old.

The way leveling is done doesn't make much sense, especially for a game based on D&D.;I dunno, I found this game extremely boring (even for an MMORPG).

A growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book.

The western, Enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don't exist in the rubric of rationalism. They are mythology. The gnostic scriptures are more like reading Hesiod's Theogony or Ovid's Metamorphoses than the New Testament. If your goal is to truly understand gnosticism Layton is indespensible.

            "__label__2 The best book for teaching social skills and I've used several!: I bought this book to help teach my 4 year old with Aspergers about how to deal with social situations. The book uses real photos of children in various situations to teach the right way to do something, like stand in line, and also shows a photo with the wrong way. It explicitly teaches, among other things, how to approach other children to play, how to ask a teacher for help, and how to have a conversation. My son loves reading the book together and I can already see him implementing the lessons after just a few weeks. For visual, step-by-step learners, this book is perfect. I own at least 6 books on teaching social skills and this is by far the best and most effective one I've used.\n",

I unfortunatley did not read reviews nor did I realize that this was coming from the UK, nor did I realize that the shipping costs were astronomical (almost more than the cost of the three openers.) My order was placed on December 8th and after three days I was notified that I would recieve them by January 7th. Obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through Amazon, I was told the openers were on their way and I did, in fact, recieve them after 10 days. I also expected the openers to look like the picture. They did not. It's a plain opener. It does not say Worlds Greatest Bottle Opener. It's plastic. It works, but it's nothing special.

Please save your money, your time, and be a bit more patient. Eventually, someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about Catherine Howard.\n",
            "__label__1 Colored hair a bluish tint: I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years. The shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple. Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn't notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so. I, of course, don't know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.David T.\n",
            "__label__2 Seek to See Him: It is most probable that the Valentinians, like the Manichaeans and the Naassenes, at least were acquainted with Thomas and incorporated some of its traditions into their works perhaps because it contains a negative world view and stresses \"knowledge\" as part of its soteriological scheme.But gnostic use does not predicate gnostic origins. We should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in Thomas into Gnosticism, not the influx of Gnosticism into Thomas. The future of research on possible connections between the Gospel of Thomas and Gnosticism should be moving in the direction of exploring the influences that this non-gnostic Gospel's ideology may have had on emerging second century gnostic systems.\n",

I am incredibly disappointed that he would include this person on his list of reputable and respected mediums, as this person is merely an actress, nothing more.

There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn't it published in Science Magazine? Talk of \"Replication and Extension Reading\" is confined to Mr. Schwartz's \"Lab,\" and we're left wondering if any of Schwartz's experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities.

I do have to say that \"Unchained Melody\" is a stand out on here as every Elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him, but the voice was stronger than ever.

It can hold 3 toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far! The one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby, they have now dented badly...and i am not hugely heavy either!

I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it's just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I've offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote \"Hoot\" if this review has or would offend him. It just didn't interest me, I am verry sorry to say.\n",

Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don't ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons.

There are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book, but none of them really mature. It left me wanting more, which isn't a problem that I normally have with Ms. Armstrong's books. Even the main storyline, with the portal unleashing a Jack the Ripper-like killer seemed shallow. There is little Pack interaction. The witches are only mentioned. Jamie pops in with a narrative hook, that goes nowhere. The newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else.As I'm reading, it occurred to me that the book, just well, seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last \"Elena\" book. Evidently, I'm not the only one thinking \"tired\" since there is a teaser for a new series by Armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different. It is about a woman \"completely of this world,\" according to the teaser.\n",

Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings.

I also love the detailing of the sleeves, and the little pockets. The material is soft, and has the slightest sheen to it - I can't imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon. What I love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile - so far I've worn it with tanks and turtlenecks, every color imaginable (I bought it in white). The versatility also means it can go with dressy, business and casual wear - and I've worn all three. It has become a staple in my wardrobe.\n",

Members of his family, children and ex-wives; continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving. This is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope.

Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn't really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her \"friends\" she befriended an \"odd\" girl named Rosamunde who she'd never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and \"nice\" and I didn't understand why she would't take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she'd made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn't Izzy's type.

I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal's boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written.

The final product is sweet and creamy, despite warnings that homemade yogurt cannot rival the texture and consistency of commercial yogurt. Not so in my case.

Store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal.

It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt.

No, the Salton YM9 is a plastic, plug-in model, and it does the job FINE. I wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly, and, if you read most ingredient labels, is often made with high-fructose corn syrup.

For example, a poem by Jaime Luis Huenun is titled \"After Reading So Much Cesar Vallejo\", and three poems of Graciela Huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku.My favorite of the poets in Elicura Chihuailaf whose poems center around blue - a color with strong ties to the Indian culture.

Irving's usual ironic humor is missing, and there doesn't seem to be anything taking it's place.\n",

I became annoyed early on when Irving describes Eddie as carrying \"a heavy duffel bag and a lighter, smaller suitcase\". Unfortunately he does this about ten (in italics) times in as many pages. After the third time I was mentally screaming \"ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET THE PICTURE. 'LUGGAGE' IS OKAY NOW.\" Irving's constant use of italics is also extremely (in italics) helpful. I couldn't have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself. NOT. Combined with the thin and dreary plot, this work is not exactly a page turner. More of a page churner.\n",

The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment.\n",
            "__label__1 Please don't bother with this one: \"A Widow for One Year\" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn't love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÑI found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÑby a different author.But, I hear \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" is well worth the read.

I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn't like it - don't do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels.

Even the \"weakest\" character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses. Also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book. It was so enlightening. Read it only after you finish... I have now decided that my next two Irving books will be Garp and Prayer for Owen Meaney. Both these novels have been tranformed to the \"big Screen\". Having seen Cider House on the big screen, I saw all that was missing. I am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to Irving.\n",
            "__label__1 I knew it wouldn't be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed: John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were \"best friends\" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn't seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth's postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much.\n",

However, after the first section, there is nothing that's either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It's my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam's red light district.\n",

No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie's life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn.

            "__label__1 Such a disappointment: It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors.\n",

            "__label__1 Shoddy research: I had the displeasure of reading this book in it's entirety this week. There wasn't any new information here at all. The \"research\" consists of stories that can be found on any conspiracy web site on the Internet. Saying that I'm not impressed is about the nicest thing I can say...This book is a major disappointment. The same information can be found anywhere on the Internet, and requires no special research. Some of the information...should be viewed with a very discerning eye.Very disappointing!\n",
            "__label__1 Unimpressive, on several levels.: That pretty much sums it up. I've seen this stuff on the web, this appears to just be a rehash without anything new and notable. The line about packing the china (which another reviewer picked up on) was hilarious. This just strikes me as a \"quick-and-dirty\" effort, more attention being paid to getting it out and making money off it than to actual content and information. Again, very unimpressive, but hey...that's what reviews are all about, right? Like someone else said, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\n",

            "__label__2 They're not from England!: Just to clear something up that was mentioned by another review, the Tender Idols are not from England. They are from Atlanta, Georgia.Anyway, that's not really the issue. The Tenders Idols have been around for a while (check out the haggered face of the guitarist - he looks like John Lennon after Yoko had sucked the life out of him) and Distressor is their third album. It's also their best, possibly because they have themselves a fairly new - and extremely talented - bassist in Joe Jones.Distressor is a mix of everything associated with Brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure. It's nothing very innovative or particularly new, but it's a very well produced album that is the kind of CD I like to listen to when I write. They're a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon.\n",

            "__label__1 Is Aleister Crowley boring? Is that possible?: It's a shame that this book is so tedious, because the author knows his subject. I read Lawrence Sutin's biography of PK Dick and I was impressed, so I had high hopes for this one. But there's no structure to the story, no plot. Sutin moves from one moment of Crowley's life to the next, never making it clear if he's describing a high point, a low point, a turning point, etc. Halfway through, I promised myself I'd finish the book, sure that as Crowley's life reached the end, Sutin would bring things to a climax. But he didn't. Sutin knows the facts but didn't present them in a compelling way.\n",
            "__label__1 Beginner romance: While Wolf has written other novels that I have enjoyed, this one felt like Introduction to Historical Romance 101. The characters were not in the least complicated, nor was the story line. The language and style felt as if it were intended for a very YOUNG female audience...Nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader, but not to one with more mature sensibilities. Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I'd prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing.\n",

Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.\n",
            "__label__2 Helps Maintain Existing Strength: I've been going to the gym for about 5 years pretty consistently now. I try to get there at least 3 times a week, but during the busy holiday months that doesn't always happen. I normally use muscle milk, but decided to give this a try after seeing it. While I didn't really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this, I was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight I am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so I think it works pretty well. So maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains, but I really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so I would use it again.\n",

            "__label__1 Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project.\n",
            "__label__1 Somewhat disappointed: After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author's prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The \"romance,\" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn't come.\n",
            "__label__1 Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing: One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \"save space\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.\n",

            "__label__2 Zippo Lighter Fluid: Zippo fluid burns much cleaner than most others, so its far easier to keep my lighter clean. Of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid, but I personally like it (yeah yeah.. don't say it). I've seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted, but mine doesn't. Its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a Zippo, even being the large 12oz can.I'm not saying anything that others already haven't, so I'll end with this. If you want your Zippo to stay reasonably clean, not stink horribly, and burn consistently... get the Zippo brand. Other brands will work, just not as well.\n",

I've been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo, but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it. The fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister.*NOTE* When I first got this, I pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my EYE. Be careful when opening the container. Also, it comes out very fast and if you're not careful will leak onto things.\n",

I gave up in the middle of the third case. The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it's a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you've got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games.\n",
            "__label__2 Nontraditional, but entertaining.: This is, simply put, not a game for everyone. This isn't a 'shoot em up', or action adventure.

It's pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors' other film, \"Shank,\" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.\n",

The picture quality is extremely poor, the appearances of Piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius. It's dedinitely not one for the average viewer!\n",
            "__label__1 Big dissappointment: Essentially, the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this DVD in English (which is the only option.)Subtitles would have done the trick nicely, enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them. When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf's words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available.\n",
            "__label__1 Cybershoot DSCS90: I've been a Sony fan as long as I remember, but this product is the worst Sony ever made.Picture qulity is bad, it won't take a high capacity memory stick, it's big and heavy.I'm looking for a diffrent camara now and this one is going to be my little girl toy.\n",
            "__label__1 Stay far far far away from SONY!!!: Ok, so we got this camera about 3 years ago and paid $150-ish. We take pictures once maybe twice a year (and NO more than a 100 total so far). Well I needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what... it's dead! It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago, but nothing else... it instantly shuts right back off.Better yet, after an hour of internet research, apparently several people have had this problem... so I dug out my old SONY camera. It took two good pictures and then the picture/video card fried! It literally started trembling in my hand.I'm done with Sony... last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too. This used to be the best quality company around, now they've obviously turned to crap.\n",
            "__label__2 Great Condtioner!: This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair. The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy. I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates it's products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair. I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!\n",

            "__label__2 Good beginning to a great series: Joe Pickett isn't your average hero. He's a game warden trainee who becomes involved in a murder when a local outfitter's body appears in his woodpile. The plot concerning greedy business interests versus a thought-to-be-extinct mammal in Wyoming's beautiful wilderness is familiar, but the characterizations are great. Joe is a courageous yet flawed hero; his wife, Marybeth, is loving yet headstrong. What happens to the characters in this novel is reflected in their emotional growth over the next books in the series and often has devastating consequences. A great read.\n",
            "__label__2 Good First book: Even though you could tell this was a first of a series with a little disjointed story to start, it quickly picked up and was a very fun read. It kept my interest through out and the end threw some great twist. I recomend this and have already bought the next two in the series.\n",
            "__label__2 Pretty good first book!: Started off a little slow for me but once it picked up I couldn't put it down. I am purchasing book number two tonight!\n",
            "__label__1 Skip this one, even if you like the VSI series: This book is neither very short nor a proper introduction. In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest \"Teach Yourself Linguistics\" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics. Also check out the excellent audio/video linguistics courses offered by \"The Teaching Company.\"\n",
            "__label__2 still going strong: I liked this season as much as the two earlier ones. It is fun to watch the new twists on the Merlin legend.The only weak episode (for me that is) is the goblin episode. But again it is unrealistic to expect all episodes to be perfect.\n",
            "__label__1 Terrible Quality Control: I ordered Season 3. The discs came scratched up. One wouldn't read properly. I got another one sent. Same thing. Discs scratched up worse than the first on some of them. One disc won't read properly. The worst scratched disc in both sets is disc 5, although 3 was scratched in both sets as was 4. Either the manufacturer is messing up or the case they're in is messing up the discs.The same thing happened with Merlin Season 2. I had to order twice because the first set was scratched. The second one was ok. So out of 4 ordered, only 1 set was non-scratched.I like the show. But these DVD sets are junk. I'd only buy the next ones locally so I could keep returning it until I get a good set.\n",

The basic unit meet my expectations with non rusting materials and a chrome finish. However the set screws provided were simple carbon steel. If used, these set screws would soon rust and the product and the tile floor would be stained. I had to purchase stainless steel set screws to assemble and install the units.\n",
            "__label__1 Buyer Beware: I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode \"Imprint\" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense.\n",

I talked to tech support and they know there is a problem and are trying to fix it. This is not acceptable. The 2006 version has a different database than the prior versions, and it has made the file much larger and for some much slower. I had to buy a new version because I use their payroll services and my 2003 is being fazed out April 30. I have just now bought the 2005 an Ebay. After printing the audit trail, I was able to record all my transactions while in the 2006 version onto my restored 2003 version and then upgraded to 2005. I know this seems like alot of work, but the 2006 was that bad for me.\n",

The ads and discription imply it has a payroll program included in it. Surprise - not only can you not run payroll, the cost of the single payroll module is more than the A/R, A/P, G/L,Inventory, reports,and tracking package you just paid for. But wait - you have the privledge of paying EVERY YEAR. I was going to switch from Peachtree but at least in PT you can (it is very obtuse and cumbersome)make the tax changes manually.

I wasn't disappointed in her latest, Dark Sky. It was an exciting, nail biting adventure.

But what record company exec, in his right mind, could green-light this awful album?The 18-49 crowd will find it absolutely laughable, and Paul's core audience (50's and up) will just scratch their heads and say, \"What the....?\"There are two laugh-out-loud songs on this CD. Trust me, I played it for several people, and the reaction was unanimous. \"Mr. Brightside\" and \"Against the Wind.\" Did Bob Seger actually okay this? What is he smoking these days?Again, can't figure out A) who would buy this, and B) who could possibly find it good.A friend gave it to me as a \"gag.\" And I just about did.Paul, thanks for your good work back in the day.

Rock Swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes, and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation. I was hoping for another helping, but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn't make it on Rock Swings. The only one that could have made it that first album is the first track \"Time After Time,\" and after that it all goes tragically down hill.\n",

Better luck next time.\n",
            "__label__1 Piece of Junk: The product arrived damaged, not from shipping damage, but from packing at the factory. Too damaged to use. Dealer said they didn't want it back. It's a good thing, because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn't run. I took the fan unit (which wan't damaged) out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs, but only at a low fan speed. Anything higher causes too much vibration noise. Also, both units we received were poorly finished, with the base being several shades lighter than the cover, which matches the picture on the box. It looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain. Thanks to the dealer who refunded our money. My email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response.\n",

The cabinet is flimsy, the unit is noisy, and the wick is a disaster! Poor engineering from the word GO.The variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds. This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!\n",

Actually, it created the same hiss even when I turned Drive and Gain all the way down. So I sent it back.I am one of very few people who report this problem about the TubePre, which is why I suspect that there might be a small number of defective boxes out there.Too bad, it looked good on paper, I liked the VU display and had been looking forward to experimenting with different tubes.I ordered the VTB-1 instead, I hope that is going to work for me.\n",

During the winter, when the bedroom gets so dry, the humidifier really does the trick. And, it may be in our heads, but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house.This product has great air quality ratings (HEPA, etc.) relative to other products in its price range, and was easy to set up, etc.Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. You need to take it all apart, etc. However, this may be the case with all of these products, and thus, may just be par for the course.We recommend this product whole-heartedly.\n",

One very good feature, at least for me, is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is the fact that it stores in floppy disks.

This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are \"best friends,\" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? \"You are my best friend. You are my only friend.\" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another.\n",
